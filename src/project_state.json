  "summary": "A web-based booking and payment DApp for “The Clearing™” (a 90‑minute, one-to-one, non-predictive tarot-based clarity session). The React/Tailwind frontend serves a high-authority landing page, supports Internet Identity authentication, can optionally gate access via invite/access code screens, forces first-time users to complete a profile (name/email), lets authenticated users pick an available date/time and pay via Stripe Checkout, and shows payment success/failure pages. An admin-only dashboard allows configuring weekly availability and managing bookings, including adding a virtual meeting link for paid sessions. The Motoko backend canister implements access control (first admin via secret token), stores user profiles, availability slots, bookings, and integrates with Stripe via HTTPS outcalls to create Checkout sessions and query session status. The repo also includes a build-template scaffolding (frontend/backend canister configs, scripts, and tooling) for deployment packaging.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Internet Computer architecture: Motoko canister backend + React SPA frontend using generated actor interface (createActorWithConfig).",
    "Authentication via Internet Identity using @dfinity/auth-client; identity context provided by a React Context provider.",
    "Role-based access control implemented in Motoko (admin/user/guest) with a first-admin bootstrap using an environment variable token and a caller-provided secret.",
    "Frontend data access centralized as React Query hooks (useQuery/useMutation) with query invalidation on mutations.",
    "Admin token handling on frontend via URL hash secret extraction and sessionStorage persistence (getSecretParameter).",
    "Stripe integration performed server-side in the canister using IC HTTPS outcalls (ic:http_request) with a transform function to strip headers.",
    "UI built with Tailwind + shadcn/ui components; next-themes used for dark mode theming.",
    "Frontend uses lightweight hash-based “routing” by inspecting window.location.hash for payment result pages rather than a router library.",
    "Availability modeled as recurring weekly slots with optional blackout dates, exposed publicly for the booking UI.",
    "Includes a generic blob-storage mixin/module for Caffeine storage gateway authorization and cycle refilling (appears template/optional in this project)."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Backend time handling is incomplete: extractTimeOfDay() always returns 00:00 and extractDayOfWeek() always returns Monday, making availability enforcement and conflict checking incorrect.",
    "Frontend booking flow creates a Stripe Checkout session but does not call backend createBooking(); bookings may never be created/stored unless another flow exists outside the provided code.",
    "No automated payment confirmation flow is present (e.g., Stripe webhooks or post-payment session verification) to update Booking.paymentStatus; admin-only manual updates exist but are not wired in the UI shown.",
    "getCallerUserProfile() traps for anonymous callers (requires #user), but the frontend may still attempt to query it when using an anonymous actor, potentially producing avoidable errors.",
    "React Query invalidation keys are inconsistent: some mutations invalidate ['bookings'] while the primary admin list query uses ['allBookings'], so UI may not refresh as expected.",
    "Stripe Checkout request body uses shipping_address_collection[allowed_countries][0] for every country in a loop (index not incremented), likely resulting in only one allowed country being honored.",
    "Sensitive Stripe secret key is stored in canister memory (not shown as stable/encrypted) and may be lost on upgrade; persistence and secret management are not addressed.",
    "Data stores (userProfiles Map, bookings Map, stripeConfiguration var, availability list) are not implemented as stable variables; state will be lost across canister upgrades.",
    "BookingSection time-slot generation is simplistic (hourly only, ignores minutes/15-min increments and blackoutDates/isRecurring semantics) and does not check already-booked times client-side.",
    "Environment variable name typo risk in blob storage module (CAFFFEINE_STORAGE_CASHIER_PRINCIPAL has triple 'F'), which may break configuration if used."
