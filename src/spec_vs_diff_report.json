  "summary": "REQ-30 appears implemented via enhanced visuals/animations in AccessCodeGate plus new supporting CSS. REQ-29 likely implemented (TikTok/Instagram links preserved), but the diff is truncated before the bottom of PractitionerAuthority.tsx so full verification that the banner <img> block is removed is not possible from provided evidence. Some global styling/motif additions in index.css appear broader than the requested access-gate refinement.",

      "id": "REQ-29",
      "requirement": "Remove the Aurora Arcana banner image rendering from the PractitionerAuthority section so no banner is displayed at the bottom of the section.",
      "reason": "PractitionerAuthority.tsx diff is truncated before the bottom of the component; the provided snippet shows headshot + social links + bio text, but does not include the prior bottom banner area, so we cannot confirm from the diff summary alone that the bottom banner <img> block was removed or is no longer rendered.",

      "description": "Broader global typography and esoteric motif utilities (e.g., grain/moon/star overlays, shimmer animation) added to global CSS beyond the access-code gate visual refinement.",
      "reason": "REQ-30 asks to refine the access-code gate entry page visuals; the diff shows multiple global style additions (typography changes and general-purpose motif utilities) that are not explicitly scoped to the access gate and could affect other pages/sections.",
