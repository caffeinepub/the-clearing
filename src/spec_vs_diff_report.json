      "requirement": "Include the new user-uploaded headshot image in the repository under frontend/public (served as a static asset) and update the PractitionerAuthority headshot <img> to reference that asset (new image file: “WhatsApp Image 2026-02-05 at 9.44.49 AM.jpeg” cropped/optimized to “facilitator-headshot.user-upload.dim_400x400.jpg”).",
      "reason": "The diff updates the <img src> to “/assets/generated/facilitator-headshot.user-upload.dim_400x400.jpg”, but there are no added files in the diff (Added: 0) and no evidence that the JPG exists under frontend/public.
