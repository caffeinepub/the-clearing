  "summary": "Diff primarily updates/creates documentation scaffolding and adds a new URL-parameter/sessionStorage utility, but does not provide evidence of an actual IC production deployment or completed runbook/domain setup docs as required.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Publish Draft Version 33 to live/production by executing the production deployment checklist (build + deploy backend and frontend to the IC network) and recording the results in a complete deployment log.",
      "reason": "The diff does not include any captured deployment output/log with date/time, operator, commit hash, DFX version, or command output, nor any evidence of executed `dfx build/deploy ... --network ic` and verification results for ic0.app/custom domain.",

      "requirement": "Expand the domain walkthrough so it fully covers retrieving the frontend canister ID, required DNS records with concrete examples, and high-level IC custom domain mapping steps, and ensure it does not end mid-step.",
      "reason": "The updated guide appears to stop at 'Method 1: Using DFX CLI (Recommended)' and ends immediately after (truncated) without showing the required concrete DNS record examples and IC domain mapping steps; based on visible content, it still ends mid-step.",

      "requirement": "Complete the production go-live runbook end-to-end after 'Environment Check', including environment validation steps, exact deploy commands, post-deploy verification for ic0.app and https://clearing.icp0.io, and required verification items/troubleshooting references.",
      "reason": "The runbook content shown still stops at 'Environment Check' and begins a 'Verify DFX version' code block without including the missing end-to-end deploy commands, verifications (ic0.app and clearing.icp0.io), or troubleshooting pointer.",

      "description": "Added URL parameter parsing + sessionStorage persistence utilities (including hash-query parsing and clearing parameters from URL hash).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on production deployment/go-live documentation and domain setup walkthrough; it explicitly lists non-goals as new product features unrelated to publishing/go-live. These utilities are new application behavior not requested by REQ-1/2/3.",
