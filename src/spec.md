# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update landing-page copy to remove any promise of providing a session recording and clarify expectations for active participation.

**Planned changes:**
- Update copy in `frontend/src/components/WhatToExpect.tsx` to remove/rewrite any statements implying a recording will be sent after the session.
- Replace the “After the Session” subsection text to emphasize active engagement during the call, welcome note-taking, and explicitly state recordings are intentionally not provided to support full presence.
- Review other landing-page sections to ensure there are no remaining mentions or implications that a recording will be provided.

**User-visible outcome:** The landing page no longer mentions receiving a session recording and instead sets clear expectations to be fully present, actively participate, and take notes during the session.
